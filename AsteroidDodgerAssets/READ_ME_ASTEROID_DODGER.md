Asteroid Dodger:This is a game like no other. In this game, the player is a spaceship that is speeding through the galaxy but constantly running out of gas. The player uses the mouse to move the spaceship around the bottom of the screen, dodging asteroids and picking up gas cans. There is a meter of gas shown in the top left corner of the screen, and it is filled more and more each time the player touches a gas can. It also runs out when there is no gas cans being picked up. The player can lose in two ways. The first way they lose is by hitting 10 asteroids. The second way is if the gas meter runs out. The way a player wins is by collecting 50 gas cans. Each 10 gas cans collected, the speed of the rocket increases by 30%. The size of the objects decreases as the game goes on, so collecting gas gets harder because of the speed and size difference. The storyline behind the game is that the player is the last person alive after the earth exploded. The player was able to make it off Earth before it exploded but was not able to bring refills of gas with them. So they are collecting gas along the way to make it to another sustainable planet with other humans on it.
